Description: michaela is beta. please report any bugs. michaela converts various stats metrics to correlation coefficients using simplistic functions, always in the format of "from.to" e.g., odd ratio to r would be or.r, aimed to allow users with no r knowledge to use for meta-analytic purpose. given bivariate metrics, all michaela functions can estimate bivariate pearson's correlation. given adjusted metrics, some michaela functions can estimate the partial correlation coefficient. see package documentation (?michaela) for a list of functions and more detailed explanations.
