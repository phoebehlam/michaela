#' @section description:
#' michaela is beta. please report any bugs\cr
#' a package for converting various stats metrics to correlation coefficient\cr
#' simple functions aimed to be user-friendly for folks without r knowledge\cr
#' all functions are in the format of "from.to" \cr
#' e.g., \emph{from} regression b and se \emph{to} r: bse.r()\cr
#' e.g., \emph{from} odd ratio \emph{to} r: or.r()\cr
#' \cr
#' all functions are documented, use ?function to see usage, arguments, and examples (e.g., ?bse.r())\cr
#'
#' \emph{\strong{a note on converting unadjusted vs. adjusted metrics:}}\cr
#' given bivariate metrics, all michaela functions can estimate bivariate pearson's correlation\cr
#' given adjusted metrics, \emph{some} michaela functions can estimate the partial correlation coefficient\cr
#' please use with caution: if you extracted adjusted metrics, make sure the function can actually estimate partial correlation\cr
#' for your convenience, equations that can take adjusted metrics are marked with *. \cr
#' \cr
#' see references section below for a list of aloe and becker's work on synthesis of partial effect size and inaccuracies in replacing bivariate corr with regression results
